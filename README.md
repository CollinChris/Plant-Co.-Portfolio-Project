## Problem Statement

Since this was a dummy dataset, the problem statements were not defined, but while creating the dashboard I have formed my own problem statements based on the data found.

- The gross profit comparison of Year to Date and Prior Year to Date went from a -265k to -77k in 2023 to 2024 respectively, find insights within the data to suggest reasons why and what actionable strageties that could be implemented to continue this upward trend.

- Create a dashboard that provides users value by showcasing important metrics and relationships between these features that would be key for improving business strategies.

- Find out which branches/countries/products are the least profitable and suggest follow up actions.

- Find out which accounts are the most profitable so that resources may be focused on them instead of being spread out to not so profitable accounts.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a xls file.
